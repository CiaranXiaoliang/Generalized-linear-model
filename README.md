# Generalized linear model
Use “melb_data.csv”dataset 
Here, we employ a binary generalized linear model to forecast the "RainTomorrow" variable, which accepts either "Yes" or "No". To resolve this binary issue, we employ the logit link function and the binomial family of distributions. Depending on the data collection and the particular challenge, the precise application of GLM can be modified and expanded. In order to anticipate the outcomes of the visualization, a mixed matrix was created and used to build the ROC curve.
